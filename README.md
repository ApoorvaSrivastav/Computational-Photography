The repository contains the Presentations of Independent Study at IIIT Hyderabad on Computational Photography

PPT 1 Contains the basic Introduction to the field of Computational Cameras and Imaging followed by the Physics behind Light and Matter Interactions. It also explains existing Digital Camera parameters and working.

PPT 2 Contains the Concepts of Light Field and Generalized Optics and their real world applications

PPT 3 Contains the Concept of Generalized Sensors, Computational Illumination and Introduction to Essence Photography which will integrate true cognition to the cameras making a paradigm shift from Digital Cameras to Computational Cameras.
